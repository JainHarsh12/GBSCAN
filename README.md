# Dynamic Urban Traffic Hotspot Detection Using GBSCAN

This project demonstrates hotspot detection in urban areas using GBSCAN (Gradient-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). The goal is to analyze geospatial data, identify traffic congestion hotspots, and visualize the results in both interactive and static formats.

## Project Structure

- **gbscan_traffic_detection.py**: Contains code for data loading, preprocessing, applying GBSCAN, and visualizing clusters.
- **README.md**: Instructions and documentation for the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists required packages for easy setup.
- **traffic_hotspot_map.html**: Interactive map output file showing congestion hotspots (generated after running the script).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
